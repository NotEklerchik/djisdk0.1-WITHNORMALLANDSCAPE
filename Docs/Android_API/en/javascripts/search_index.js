This set of photos can be stitched into panoramic photos using third-party libraries. The panorama photo mode can be set by `KeyPhotoPanoramaMode`, the panorama photo mode can be judged by `KeyIsShootingPhotoPanorama`, and the progress of panorama photo can be obtained by `KeyPhotoPanoramaProgress`. After setting this mode, you need to call `KeyStartShootPhoto` to take a panoramic photo. During the shooting process, you can call `KeyStopShootPhoto` to stop panorama shooting. <b>Notic:  Panoramic photo mode can only be activated after the aircraft takes off.</b>",
